for someone who has eidetic memory
i sure do think and hyperfixiate on memories and theories on memories .

memories are extremely complex per person, some people have good short term, bad long term, vice versa .

trauma affects memories also, giving you hightened memory. like PTSD, flashbacks, but also PTSD can damage memory .

when the brain processes a memory or any information it goes through a sorting process of "is this important"
so if you typically dont care (genuinley) it will be YEETED by sorting . 

but when you DO care, atleast about knowing it later . is there a time frame before your brain yeets it? or does it deem it not important anymore and filter it because you havent thought about it in awhile?

this is something that kindof scares me about memories . what if i dont think about my favorite memories for awhile and they're gone? 

loving to dissociate and having eidetic memory i feel like has maybe helped me keep so many long term memories, when i want to leave, I LEAVE, I GO there, remembering every detail, the smell, what was on tv, the spec of lint on the floor .

but whenever i stop dissociating due to therapy will i lose all these memories? will i lose all these places and movies of the people i love and places and moments i cherish so much?

this is something i really like about myself, especially because im mostly alone, introverted and hard to reach . THIS is how i spend time with people .

like yeah, journaling is great for this, but looking into peoples eyes crystal clear once again while laying in a dark cold room alone . or going back to smelling the grass or pavement outside at a place i adore . 
remebering the moss and smell of the tree that was cut down that had my tire swing growing up, doesnt really compare .
